# Ecommerce-Trends-and-Efficiency
In-depth sales and performance analysis for an ecommerce business, includes insights on historical sales trends, product mix, operational efficiency, and marketing performance.
## Summary
This company saw explosive growth in 2020, followed by an increasingly sharp decline in revenue, orders, and AOV beginning in Q1 '22.
### **Product Mix** 
My analysis found that three SKUs drove 85% of revenue and recommends finding alternate, in-class products to maximize sales performance.
### **Loyalty Program** 
Launched in 2019, the loyalty program now accounts for more than half of all annual revenue. More importantly, this cohort of customers actively responds to email marketing campaigns and have proven more resilient to the current downward trends in revenue. This program is a key lever the company can use to improve sales performance.
### **Mobile App and User Device** 
Mobile app purchases have increased from 6% in '19 to 25% in '21, while mobile device users have increased total spend by an average of 20% year-over-year. Incentivizing mobile users to adopt the app as their primary purchasing channel can ride this trend to improve sales performance.

## Key Findings
### **1.	Product Mix**
Three products (desktop monitors, Bluetooth headphones, and Mac laptops) make up 85% of revenue and 70% of all orders, suggesting that comparable in-class products should be researched for possible addition to inventory, i.e., additional desktop dimension options, Samsung-compatible Bluetooth headphones, and alternate laptop products.

### **2.	Sales Performance and Loyalty**
While revenue and order counts are below 2019 performance, loyalty program participants now represent most of the revenue (56% in ‘22, up from 10% in ‘19) and order counts (52% in ‘22, up from 11% in ‘19). Loyalty program participants also show better resistance to downward trends in annual spend and annual order counts.

Loyalty members are twice as responsive to email campaigns as non-loyalty members in the company’s four largest markets. This gives the company an opportunity to drive future sales with targeted email campaigns.

Loyalty Members request refunds 3.4% more often than non-loyalty members. This suggests they are more willing to take a chance on products through our company and should be targeted when new products are added to the inventory.

### **3.	Sales Channels and Customer Device Interaction**
Although orders made through the company’s mobile app account for only 3% of revenue due to a low AOV, they account for 25% of all placed orders in the past two years.

Further, revenue generated through mobile device users have increased by an average of 20% year-over-year, suggesting that the mobile app can play a larger role in driving sales through a marketing campaign promoting the mobile app to mobile device users.
