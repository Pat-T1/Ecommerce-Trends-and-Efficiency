-- Q4: Whatâ€™s the average order value across different account creation methods in the first two months of 2022? Which method had the most new customers in this time?

--Q4A: AOV for new customer accounts in Jan/Feb '22
-- This code counts total orders and tallies AOV (revenue/order count) while filtering out customers with unknown account creation methods
